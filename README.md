# Gods who are easily understood
Despite our claims to modernity, the average American will cling to many embarrassing beliefs. Perhaps foremost among them is a belief that the God of the bible is a staunch ally in the war for conservative values. Practically savages.

It should come as no surprise to you then that not only is the God of the bible absent from the front lines of these fashionable wars on drugs, terror and other boogie men in brown wrappers, but that he is also absent from our alters. In his stead I have found a selection of various dieties, demons and downright delirious day dreams which can more charitably said to characterize their congregants than they can the God they profess to worship. I will attempt to collect several of them here for your edification, and correct them for our own.
