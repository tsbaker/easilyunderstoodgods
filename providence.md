# Why does anyone think that anything will be ok? #

"Don't worry. Everything will work out in the end." I don't know how many times I've heard that said to me. Sometimes its for little things. More often someone says it in response to some big hairy thing. The kind of thing that you can't see through to the other side. Precisely when things are least likely to actually go well.

I cannot for the life of me understand why someone would say such a thing. What proof is offered in support of the idea that things will just work out? Nothing, often because none can be offered. To do so would be to call on the divine.

## According to the Internet (ie Google)
I was not sure when this kind of god came into the public conscience. So, as all inquiring souls do, I consulted the oracle. Not the Oracle, good lord no. In any case, according Google the believe in divine providence, the belief that within the cosmic order that the gods looked favorably down on and directed the course of human events can be traced to the greeks. [Encyclopedia Brittanica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Providence-theology)
>The English word providence is derived from the Latin term providentia, which primarily means foresight or foreknowledge but also forethought and providence in the religious sense; thus, Cicero used the phrase the “providence of the gods” (deorum providentia).

Apparently the stoics were quite fond of writing about divine providence, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, no doubt for the benefit that such a belief would induce in a human being to live a productive yet quiet life. Equally interesting, by 400CE providence is referred to directly as a god and not just as the actions of a god.

## An American god for an American Virtue

It is perhaps no wonder then that a deeply religious and yet diverse a people that we Americans are would so quickly grab hold of a divinity so divorced from its nature. It is no great secret that the founding fathers were often great moral virtuizers, if poor dogmatists. Benjamin Franklin presents an excellent case study of these bewigged gentleman and their belief that a moral compass was a necessary part of any functioning republic. [Pennsylvania Heritage](http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/portal/communities/pa-heritage/religion-early-politics-benjamin-franklin.html)

>"Without the Belief of a Providence that takes Cognizance of, guards and guides, and may favour particular Persons, there is no Motive to Worship a Deity, to fear its Displeasure, or to pray for its Protection,"

And without that continued prayer, there would be little to foster virtue in the young republic. Providence conveniently bridged the gap between the many different Christianities on the continent and the enlightenment ideals that governed it.

## Fortunately for free

It can be easy to see how pleasant a belief in an ordered universe that is generally benevolent can be. It is more than just an inducement to virtue. Its salve in hard times. At least, the shorter though looked for hard times. Rarely is Providence invoked for extended periods. Sure, perhaps in a bad harvest one may remember that Providence is looking down, or rather was. A run of bad luck, or a temporary loss of job title or status might supply a similar albeit temporary reminder.

The belief in a god of providence does not require that things always be good. In fact, a temporary setback allows the human mind to supply the narrative that they have a special place in the universe. Every rags to riches story requires a set back of two. In fact, we need it, crave it even. What other way to prove our own worth? You see, the god of providence is not merely a cosmic candy man doling out mana and lollipops to all of the good little children. No no no. He is the loving father, the one whose sons and daughters have done what they needed to do to find favor. They are the worthy heirs to the pearly gates. The belief in Providence is a belief in their own worth to receive the gifts of heaven.

## The manifestly personal
God is no cornucopia, no horn of plenty in the sky raining down goodness to all of his little ones. For one thing, he regularly and routinely asserts his personhood. He walks in the garden with the first born of his creation, Adam and Eve. He stands at the door of our heart, knocking, waiting to be let in. This God no fairy god mother come to remove the obstacles to our ball. He demands to know, and be known, for his love.

His distinct personhood is necessarily to understand the second point about himself, that he came suffered and died for our sins.  A cruel and public execution. The kind of execution that only a civilization with hundreds of millions of subjects and a thousand year need public order and obedience could invent.

Moreover, he promised his followers that they would suffer as well.

Maybe confusing the words about plenty,
maybe confuse the words about all things working for the good

Surely there is death
Surely there will be pain.
Certainly there is no guarantee of wealth
There is no guarantee of peace

There is a guarantee of himself. He is the ultimate prize. The ultimate reward. The ultimate peace.
